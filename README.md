# Project 1 - Parametric and Nonparametric Learning
Project 1 for COSC 522 - Machine Learning - at UTK

This README will describe how to run the code associated with this project. Please see the report for an in-depth analysis of the results of these models.
The project writeup can be found at [this link](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~hqi/cosc522/project/proj1.htm). The entire documentation for the code can be found in the docstrings within the classes and functions that I have written.

### Cleaning data
The script that I used to clean my data for this project is in parse_data.py. This script is just for reference because the cleaned data has already been included in the data directory.

## Section 1 
The files for this portion are contained in the parametric_model directory.

### Part A
The code for this portion is in the parametric_model/scatterplot_data.py file. All you need to do to generate the scatterplot (shown below) is to run this script.

### Part B
For this part, run the parametric_model/run_classifier.py script. This will also output the decision boundaries (for Section 1, part D) after printing the accuracy statistics for each discriminant function on the synth dataset. You must then close out of the decision boundary plot, and then the script will run the classifier on the Pima dataset and print the accuracy statistics.

### Part C
No code is associated with this part.

### Part D
This plot (shown below) will be output to the screen when running the parametric_model/run_classifier.py script.

### Part E
On the report, I generated 4 separate plots for this part. To generate the plots shown to the right on each section, you will just run the script parametric_model/run_prior_prob.py. In order to generate the plots shown to the left, this will require changing the code in parametric_model/MD_classifier.py. You will have to go to this file and uncomment line 276 while commenting line 275. Then, the plots to the left should show up after running the parametric_model/run_prior_prob.py script.

## Section 2
All of the code for this section is contained in the kNN directory.

### Part A
To generate similar output to that provided by parametric_model/run_classifier.py, run the script kNN/run_kNN.py. This outputs given accuracy statistics and runtimes for a k values ranging from 1 - 14. In order to specify whether to run the classifier for "synth" or "Pima" data, set the "dataset" variable (as explained in the comments).

### Part B
The data that I produced in this section in the report can be generated by running kNN/run_kNN_individual.py. Please see the comments in this file about how to change the code in order to run for either the synth or the Pima dataset.

### Part C
There was no code associated with this part of the project.

### Part D
The plot that I produced in the report (shown below) can be reproduced by running the kNN/plot_decision_boundaries.py script. If you want to change the k value associated with the plot, simply edit the value in the plot_boundaries function call within the script.

## Extra Credit 1
The portion of the kNN class that implements this extra credit is on line 107 where we multiply the number of votes by our prior probabilities in order to weight them. The instrcutions for generating the plots are shown below:

### Generating Bar Plots
To genereate the bar plots shown in the report (like the one below), run the script kNN/run_ec_part1.py.

### Generating plots for Accuracy vs. Prior Probability for Varying k Values 
In order to generate the plots seen later in this extra credit section, run the script kNN/run_ec1_part2.py.The values that I have in there currently are associated with the numbers on the report. Feel free to modify these values, such as prior probabilities to try, in order to try to mimic my results. 

## Extra Credit 2
The code that implements the methods described in the report for this extra credit assignment is all located in the parametric_model directory. Every file associated contains the substring "ec2" in the name of the file.

### Generating Cluster Separations
To generate the cluster separations (as shown below), run the parametric_model/ec2_graph_splits.py script.

![Split](https://github.com/owencqueen/ML_project1/blob/master/images/ec2_boundaries.png)

### Generating the Contour Plots
To plot the contours of the two bimodal Gaussian distributions (as shown below for class 0), you can run the script named parametric_model/ec2_fit_distributions.py. This script by default generates the plot for the class 0 distribution. If you want to change this to be class 1, go to the bottom of the script and change the "class_number" argument in the plot_contours function to 1.

### Running the Classifier with Bimodal Discriminant
In order to run the classifier with this generated bimodal discriminant function, you can run the script parametric_model/run_ec2_predictions.py. This will output the statistics for the classifier ran with a values of 0.5 for both classes.

### Finding the a Values with Maximum Accuracies
